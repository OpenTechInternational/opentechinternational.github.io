# About Open Tech International

## Our Approach
We are practical, hard-working and aim for excellence and truth-seeking in what we do. We recognize that meaningful progress is a mix of technological advancement and the simpler things in life. Connection, joy, health, and dignity guide our priorities and design choices. While we attend meticulously to technical details, we always consider how they serve fundamental human needs and fit within complex social and environmental systems. Real impact, in our experience, only happens through direct collaboration with people—with eyes and feet on the ground in the communities we serve.

## Definitions: Open Tech International

### Open
At OpenTech International, "open" means creating and sharing knowledge and tools without unnecessary barriers. We believe that openness is a fundamental catalyst for empowerment, innovation, and collective growth. While security is a key value and proprietary information is occasionally necessary, we believe barriers to knowledge should be considered the exception rather than the default. When communities have ownership and information flows freely, trust develops naturally, misalignments become visible, and collaborative problem-solving thrives.

### Technology
We define technology broadly—from physical devices and methodical systems to social coordination methods and artistic mediums. At its core, technology is purposeful design that solves problems and extends human capabilities. While software development is our primary expertise, we embrace technology's full spectrum, often combining new and traditional approaches.

This perspective guides our project selection. Though we primarily address serious challenges, we occasionally pursue projects that simply bring beauty or delight to communities, recognizing that flourishing societies need both practical solutions and nourishment for the human spirit.

### International
"International" acknowledges that while we belong to distinct nations and cultures, we share one planet with a collective future. We value the rich mosaic of traditions, perspectives, and knowledge systems that define our world—not just as cultural assets but as critical drivers of innovation and resilience. We recognize that meaningful advancement comes from the intersection of innovation and traditional wisdom and must be rooted in users' realities. We also embrace the tremendous possibilities that emerge when knowledge flows freely across borders.

## How We Think About Money
We're not opposed to capital—and we believe firmly that lasting impact requires financially viable and operationally sustainable solutions. We also believe that no community should be denied essential services due to lack of resources when viable solutions exist. As an organization focusing on basic needs, our profits will be reinvested in expanding our mission and serving communities traditionally overlooked by profit-driven approaches. We aim to be successful and sustainable, forming partnerships based on mutual respect rather than dependency. Financial returns are an essential part of our strategy, but progress toward a thriving world is our true bottom line.
