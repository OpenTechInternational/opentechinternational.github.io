# Bridging the Digital Divide in Water and Sanitation Management

## The Challenge

While water and sanitation utilities in high-income countries increasingly leverage digital tools to improve operations, utilities in Sub-Saharan Africa face a growing technological gap. Despite serving millions of people in rapidly growing urban centers, these essential service providers often lack access to the digital solutions that could help them address critical challenges:

* High rates of non-revenue water
* Inefficient asset management
* Communication barriers with customers
* Limited data for operational decision-making
* Maintenance difficulties
* Highly manual processes prone to error and failure

When digital interventions do occur, they're typically one-off projects that aren't built for sustainability or scale.

## Our Vision

At OpenTech International, we envision a world where water and sanitation utilities across all regions have access to the digital tools they need to deliver services efficiently. We don't believe the digital divide should exist. Whether through creating new solutions, adapting existing ones, or facilitating access to tools already in the market, our goal is to ensure every utility can benefit from appropriate digital technology.

Building on the experience with the open-source MajiFix CRM in Dar es Salaam and Mwanza (which our founder Kristen Tonga worked on before establishing OpenTech International), we're now expanding our focus to address the broader digital needs of water and sanitation service providers throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.

## The Research-First Approach

As technical experts with experience spanning both for-profit and non-profit sectors, we've learned that lasting digital transformation requires more than just good code. It demands deep understanding of operational realities across different contexts.

That's why we're conducting a comprehensive 2-year research initiative before developing or recommending solutions. This research phase includes:

* **Field assessments at diverse utilities** to identify common challenges (1-2 weeks per visit)
* **Embedded partnerships** with forward-thinking utilities where we provide immediate value while gaining operational insights (2-weeks to 3-months)
* **Academic collaboration** to ensure our approach incorporates global best practices

We believe that many of the problems faced by utilities in Sub-Saharan Africa are likely shared across both the Global North and South. While our initial focus is on bridging the digital divide, our ultimate goal is to facilitate solutions that can benefit utilities worldwide. By understanding both the similarities and differences between utilities, we can help create or adapt solutions that are:
1. Genuinely useful across multiple contexts
2. Easy to implement and maintain
3. Sustainable over the long term

## For Water and Sanitation Utilities: Become a Research Partner

We're actively seeking partnerships with forward-thinking water and sanitation utilities ready to explore digital transformation. By participating in our research initiative, your utility will:

* Shape the development of digital tools designed for your operational realities
* Gain early access to open-source solutions as they emerge
* Receive technical support and training tailored to your needs
* Join a growing network of utilities committed to innovation

Our collaboration begins with Kristen Tonga, our founder and initiative lead, conducting an on-site assessment at your facility. With extensive experience in software engineering and user research across startup, enterprise, and humanitarian contexts, Kristen brings technical expertise while approaching water and sanitation sector specifics with an open mind and eagerness to learn.

The engagement typically includes:
* Evaluating your current technical systems
* Identifying immediate opportunities for digital enhancement
* Possibly implementing targeted solutions that address pressing needs

Partners who join during this foundational research phase will help shape our development roadmap and receive priority support as we move into implementation.

## Beyond Water: A Holistic Approach

While water and sanitation service providers remain our focus, we recognize that effective solutions often cross traditional boundaries. Our "Wider than Water" mindset keeps us alert to complementary challenges and opportunities that may arise during our research.

## Join Us on the Journey

If your utility is ready to explore digital transformation, we invite you to join us in this initiative. Together, we can create a future where technology enhances water and sanitation service delivery for all communities, regardless of geography or resources.
